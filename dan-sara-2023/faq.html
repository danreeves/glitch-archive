          <h2>Where can I stay?</h2>

          <p>
          We have not booked any rooms/hotel so that people can plan out their London stay as it suits them best!
          </p>
          <p>
          The venue itself is in Camden Town where there are plenty of transport link connections so feel free to stay in an area of London that looks the most interesting/has accomodations that work for you!
            <p>
          Camden Town station (on the Northern Line) is a 5 minute walk from the venue. Camden Road overground station is also just a few minutes' walk away! There are plenty of buses <strong>and</strong> two major train stations (Euston and St.Pancras/King's Cross) within a 15-20 minute walk!

        <h2>Do you have a registry?</h2>
        
        <p>
          We don't have a registry! You don't have to get us any gifts! Celebrating together is what we want to do most.
        </p>
      
        <h2> Where do I share dietary restrictions?        </h2>
        <p>
          Closer to the event date the team at the venue will send out a form for you to fill and pre-order your meal! Please let them know if you need anything.
